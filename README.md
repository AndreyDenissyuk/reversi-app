# Reversi App
A simple C# application that allows two players to play a Reversi game

## How to run it
- clone repo
- open project folder in Visual Studio
- select ReversiApp.sln as main solution
- click "Run"
- enjoy the game =)

If you don't have Visual Studio, it's going to be hard to build the project, but you still can look at code and run the prebuilt file _./ReversiApp/bin/Debug/ReversiApp.exe_

## Plans for the future:
- add AI with possibility of selecting it's level
- improve UI and make it more pretty
